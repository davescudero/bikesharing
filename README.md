# Module 14 | Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview 

The purpose of this analyisis was to use **Tableau** as our primary tool to deep dive into the Citi bike program in New York City.

## Results

 [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.escudero3401/viz/Newyorkbikeschallenge/BikeSharingProgram?publish=yes)

1.  First we have the total number of trips in the visualization.
2. We can see which are the peak hours for the rides, wich are between 5 pm and 6 pm, with this information we can make an insight about people coming back from work using Bikes.
3. Then next visualization represent the number of users distribuited by gender, so that we can have another insight going deeper into the next visualizations.
4. Next we can see a map with Top Starting points and the Top Ending Points, so we can launch a better route or improve the existing ones, and also we can see the less afluent routes.
5. Then the next visualizations are  about trip duration; by analyzing it, we can tell the mean bike usage is around 5-7 minutes with as much of 33,000 bikes used by females and 110,000 bikes used by males.
6. Finally we have the heatmaps, where we can see the amount of trips per day of the week, where we can see that besides being thursday the day with the most trips, there´s an increasing  on weekends, so we can determine that not only people use bikes for transportation, but recreation too

## Summary
As a Sumary we can con conclude that this program is better suited for men, so I suggest we can deep dive even more into this, maybe the bikes are not comfotable for women, the trips aren´t safe or women just don´t like it, we should investigate more about it.
Also I suggest we make more emphasys on the places where people arent using the bikes that much, maybe there´s not enough infrastructure for bike routes.
And finally people ten to use more bikes in trips around five minutes, so maybe on those places we can implement more durable bikes so people can use them for longer trips.
